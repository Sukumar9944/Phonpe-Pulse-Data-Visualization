## Project Title

**Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly**

# Libraries used

- Github Cloning
- Python
- Pandas
- MySQL
- mysql-connector-python
- Streamlit
- Plotly

## Problem Statement

The Phonepe Pulse Github repository contains a significant amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The objective is to extract, process, and visualize this data in a user-friendly manner. The solution involves several steps:

1. Extract data from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository through scripting and cloning.
2. Transform and preprocess the data using Python and Pandas.
3. Insert the cleaned data into a MySQL database for efficient storage.
4. Create an interactive geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
5. Fetch data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. Provide 10 dropdown options for users to select various data visualizations.

## Approach

1. **Data Extraction:** Clone the Github repository to fetch the data and store it in a suitable format.
2. **Data Transformation:** Use Python and Pandas for data preprocessing, including cleaning and transformation.
3. **Database Insertion:** Utilize `mysql-connector-python` to connect and insert transformed data into a MySQL database.
4. **Dashboard Creation:** Employ Streamlit and Plotly to design an interactive dashboard with dynamic visualizations.
5. **Data Retrieval:** Use `mysql-connector-python` to connect to MySQL and fetch data for dashboard updates.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the solution securely, test thoroughly, and make the dashboard accessible to users.

## Results

The outcome of this project will be an interactive geo visualization dashboard that presents insights from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository in a visually engaging manner. The dashboard will have various dropdown options, allowing users to explore different facets of the data. Data stored in a MySQL database will ensure efficient retrieval and dashboard updates. Users can access and navigate the dashboard through a web browser to gain valuable insights from the Phonepe Pulse data.
